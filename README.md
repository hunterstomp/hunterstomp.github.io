## üìù How to Add a New Case Study (Contributor Guide)

1. **Open Sanity Studio**
   - Run `npm run dev` in `ux-sanity-studio` and open the local studio URL.

2. **Create a New Case Study**
   - Click "Create new" and select "UX Case Study".
   - Fill in all required fields: `Title`, `Company`, `Summary`, `Tags`, and `Body` (main narrative).
   - The `slug` will auto-generate from the title (can be edited if needed).

3. **Add Flows and Images**
   - Under "Flows", add each major flow or phase (e.g., Discovery, Usability Test).
   - For each flow, add images. Each image can have a caption and sidebar notes.

4. **Add Assets**
   - In the "Assets" section, upload any non-image files (PDFs, docs, etc.).
   - Add a label/title and optional description for each asset.

5. **Set Access and Metadata**
   - Set persona access, NDA protection, YouTube embed, etc. as needed.

6. **Preview and Test**
   - Visit `/case-studies/` to see your new case study in the list.
   - Click through to `/case-studies/[slug]` to verify detail view, images, assets, and lightbox/modal work as expected.
   - Check that all images have captions and alt text.

7. **Troubleshooting**
   - If your case study doesn't appear, check that all required fields are filled and the slug is unique.
   - For schema or field issues, restart Sanity Studio after making changes.

8. **Ready for Review**
   - Mark incomplete/draft studies with a WIP tag to hide from public view.
   - Ask for a review or run a manual usability test before publishing.
